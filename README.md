# spark-cdm

A prototype Spark data source for the Azure "Common Data Model". Reading and writing is supported, but spark-cdm is definitely a work in progress. Please file issues for any bugs that you find. For more information about the Azure Common Data Model, check out [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/data-lake). <br>

Note: currently only Spark 2.3 is supported.

## Example

1. Create an AAD app and give the service principal the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role on the ADLSgen2 storage account used for your CDM data.
2. Install the JAR in the `release` directory in this repo on your Spark cluster.
3. Check out the below code for basic read and write examples.

```scala
val df = spark.read.format("com.microsoft.cdm")
                .option("cdmModel", "https://YOURADLSACCOUNT.dfs.core.windows.net/FILESYSTEM/path/to/model.json")
                .option("entity", "Query")
                .option("appId", "YOURAPPID")
                .option("appKey", "YOURAPPKEY")
                .option("tenantId", "YOURTENANTID")
                .load()

// Do whatever spark transformations you want
val transformedDf = df.filter(...)

// entity: name of the entity you wish to write.
// modelDirectory: writes to a model.json file located at the root of this directory. note: if there is already a model.json in this directory, we will append an entity to it
// modelName: name of the model to write. N/A in append case for now.
transformedDf.write.format("com.microsoft.cdm")
            .option("entity", "FilteredQueries")
            .option("appId", "YOURAPPID")
            .option("appKey", "YOURAPPKEY")
            .option("tenantId", "YOURTENANTID")
            .option("cdmFolder", "https://YOURADLSACCOUNT.dfs.core.windows.net/FILESYSTEM/path/to/output/directory/")
            .option("cdmModelName", "MyData")
            .save()
```
